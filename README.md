# New-York-Housing
As I’m graduating in December 2019 and will start to work in New York City in 2020, I started to search for information about housing market in New York City and areas around in this semester. I think about renting an apartment in the midtown of Manhattan or ones in the downtown Brooklyn. During the process of comparing the housing prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn, I had some intuitive sense on some factors affecting the housing prices, but it’s still hard to generate the exact patterns or trends among so many different factors and data, and offer any quantitative proof. Thus, my research question came as what
factors affect the housing prices in these two regions and how much influence they impose on the housing prices. Combined with the regression models, I think by running a regression model on some of the attributes to make predictions on housing prices should be a good solution for my question. Since the housing data is highly correlated with geography and location, I decided to use gwr package in python and also geopanda for data frame, which I’ll explain more details later in this report paper.
